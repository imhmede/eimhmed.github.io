## About Me
I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Eastern New Mexico University, holding M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from New Mexico State University. I lead the Software Engineering and Performance Optimization (_SEPO_) Lab, where we explore data management and replacement schemes for a novel scratchpad memory design. My group and I also investigate the application of Agile methods in education, as well as teaching strategies and assessment techniques to enhance studentsâ€™ coding experiences. This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, preparing students for success in the evolving field of computer science.
