Timely, formative feedback is essential in academia, helping students reinforce learning and develop skills for subsequent assignments and advanced topics. However, manually assessing code submissions is time-consuming and often delays feedback. This project investigates state-of-the-art automated code assessment techniques and proposes CodeInspector—a CI-based system that leverages industry-standard software tools to enable students to submit their code frequently for immediate feedback on quality and correctness while supporting iterative learning and improvement.

Local Memory Store (LMStore) is a novel scratchpad memory (SPM) design, featuring some hardware management of the SPM along with explicit access and interaction by the program. Rather than presenting the program with a flat, directly accessed address space, LMStore uses indirect references in the form of 2-tuples and 3-tuples to access data stored in its memory, allowing LMStore to manage its memory more effectively for better utilization. This project explores data management schemes specifically designed to maximize LMStore performance, with a focus on reducing power consumption and minimizing memory access latency in embedded programs.
